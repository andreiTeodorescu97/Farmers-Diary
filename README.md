The Farmer's Diary aims to reduce bureaucracy in the legislative relationship between the farmer and the state by creating <br />
a web application to automate administrative processes. Thus, the proposed solution allows automatic reporting and the creation of a digital <br />
infrastructure for data collection to facilitate farm interaction with state allowance mechanisms and financing programs. <br />
Through the product developed, the team promises to save time and resources for both the state and for farmers.
